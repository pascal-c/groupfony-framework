# Groupfony Framework
A lightweight php framework based on Symfony Components

## Main goals
1. for small and medium sized projects
2. I wanted Controller actions to be automatically injected with services by Type Hinting the parameters.  
See Usage->Controller Section for details.

```JSON
{
    "require": {
        "groupfony/framework":          "~0.1"
    }
}
```
